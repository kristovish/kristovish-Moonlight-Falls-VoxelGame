Flying carpet =

# Long description
Quickly explore the vast terrain with the magical flying carpet. But only the skilled users can master its speed, the fools will crash and hurt themselves. The carpet flies fast horizontally, but is only slowly able to change its rotation or height. =

\sIt will wear out over time. =

\sIt constantly reduces your mana resources and will wear out over time. =

\sIt constantly reduces your mana resources. =

# Usage help strings
Look to the desired initial flight direction and place the carpet on any flat open surface. Make sure it has enough space (3×2×3), then place it. Right-click the carpet to sit on it and depart. You can only enter the flying carpet if it is not moving itself and you're not in another vehicle. =

Flight is controlled with the movement keys: Up to speed up, down to slow down, left and right to rotate slowly. Jump to rise, sneak to sink. =

The flying carpet has a basic movement speed which it is aiming to reach; thus, it flies without your intervention. Speed changes apply only for as long as you hold down the keys. As soon as you release the keys, the carpet will go back to its basic speed again. When the carpet is under a certain critical speed, it loses its magic and just drops on the ground. There's a short “grace period” at the beginning of the flight where this minimum speed limit does not apply. Watch the particles emitted by the carpet carefully: If they are yellow, everything is okay, but if they become red this means the carpet is going dangerously slow and you should speed up. =

If you fly directly down onto a flat solid ground, your flying carpet will come to a halt quickly due to friction. Your carpet can not fly into liquids from above, but it can fly into them from the side or even below. But the speed in liquids is greatly reduced and your carpet will likely fail. =

The flying carpet also fails immediately if you crash into the landscape, which may even hurt you. You can also also take fall damage, but it is greatly reduced. =

\sYour carpet will also stop working if your mana resources are depleted. =

\sWhen your carpet stopped working, you have to collect the carpet (punch it) and place it again. =

Your carpet is not indestructible! Long flights, scratching and crashes will wear out the carpet over time and it might get destroyed eventually. Crashes deal major damage, sliding deals a very minor wear and flying deals a tiny amount of wear. =

On high wear levels, the carpet will emit black particles which will increase in number with its wear. At this point, you should get a replacement soon. On a critical wear level, the carpet will emit a very annoying loud noise while flying. If you hear this, you will have roughly five minutes worth of flight until the carpet finally disintegrates under your feet! Additionally, a flying carpet will disintegrate and is lost forever if it stands still and has no user for 1 minute. =

Ca. 12 hours worth of flight time, if you fly without accidents. =
