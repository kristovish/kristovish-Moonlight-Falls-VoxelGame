# Calendar Node

This mod adds a placable and craftable calendar.
(See the crafting guide to see how to craft it.)

Provided you have the `calendar` mod, you can use the calendar to view
the current in-game date in the HUD.

See the `calendar` mod to learn more about the calendar system.

If the `calendar` mod is not found, the placable calendar is basically just
a decorative block.
